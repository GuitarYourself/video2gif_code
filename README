Video2GIF code, version 0.9

The Video2GIF dataset contains over 100,000 pairs of GIFs and their source
videos. The GIFs were collected from two popular GIF websites (makeagif.com,
gifsoup.com) and the corresponding source videos were collected from YouTube in
Summer 2015. We provide IDs and URLs of the GIFs and the videos, along with
temporal alignment of GIF segments to their source videos. The dataset shall be
used to evaluate GIF creation and video highlight techniques.

In addition to the 100K GIF-video pairs, the dataset contains 357 pairs of GIFs
and their source videos as the test set. The 357 videos come with a Creative
Commons CC-BY license, which allows us to redistribute the material with
appropriate credit. We provide this test set to make the results reproducible
even when some of the videos become unavailable.
